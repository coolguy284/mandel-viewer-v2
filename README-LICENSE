Can choose to follow either MIT or Unlicense; MIT made available in case
Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note 1: The file js_lib/gl-matrix-min.js is made by someone else and thus follows
a different license, which appears at the top of the file (it is simply MIT but
with that file's author and an earlier copyright date).

Note 2: The file js_lib/math_js_11.8.0.js is made by someone else and thus follows
a different license, which can be found at https://unpkg.com/browse/mathjs@11.8.0/LICENSE
(it is the Apache 2.0 license).

Note 3: The file "media/sorting algos.mp3" is the audio from the youtube video
Timo Bingmann: 15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes, found at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg (used for an easter egg). Therefore,
the MIT+Unlicense license of this repository does not apply to this file.
